Same seven notes and some slag poet's quotes

Stick them together with glue

You can mix a fine cocktail from memories

And pretend what you're drinking is new

But there's nothing that's new under heaven


There's nothing that hasn't been done

Pour me another double cliche

You can't write a song that's never been sung

Everyone's stealing from someone

Burglars get burgled as well

There's nothing that's new under heaven

There's nothing unique over hell

There's nothing that's new under heaven


You can't write a song that's never been sung

You can't write a song that's never been sung
